CONFIDENTIAL EXECUTIVE MEMORANDUM
================================================================================
TO:      Board of Directors, Mall of Zimbabwe (WestProp Holdings)
FROM:    Lead Data Scientist & Energy Strategy Team
DATE:    December 19, 2025
SUBJECT: Pre-Construction Lifecycle Cost Analysis & AI Optimization
================================================================================

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (THE 'SMART MALL' INITIATIVE)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In preparation for the 2026 construction phase, we have conducted a comprehensive
Lifecycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) to forecast the Mall's operational energy demand.

Our AI simulation projects an annual base load of 25.9 Million kWh,
representing an OpEx liability of $3.63 Million per year.

We have identified a verified savings potential of $1.66 Million (45.8%)
by integrating a 4MW Solar Microgrid and AI-driven BMS controls into the design.

2. OPERATIONAL BASELINE (SIMULATED DIGITAL TWIN)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Annual Energy Demand:  25,912,195 kWh
• Peak Power Demand:     14,650 kW
• Energy Intensity:      288 kWh/m²/year (Optimized vs SA Avg)
• Grid Resilience:       Model accounts for 6% grid failure rate (ZESA Load Shedding)

3. AI MODELING VALIDATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To ensure financial accuracy, we benchmarked multiple AI forecasting models.
The XGBoost (Gradient Boosting) model proved superior for Zimbabwe's volatile grid.

• Winning Model:         XGBoost (98.0% Accuracy)
• Defeated Models:       Prophet (Failed on outliers), LSTM (Slower adaptation)
• Mean Error:            ±66 kWh per hour
• Strategic Value:       Allows for 'Virtual Commissioning' of HVAC systems before purchase.

4. STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PLAN (CAPEX RECOMMENDATIONS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INITIATIVE 1: ROOFTOP SOLAR (4MW)
   • Annual Savings:     $1,124,200
   • Payback Period:     4.5 Years
   • Implementation:     Include 4MW solar spec in architectural roof design.

INITIATIVE 2: AI HVAC OPTIMIZATION
   • Annual Savings:     $182,836
   • Payback Period:     0.8 Years
   • Implementation:     Specify AI-compatible BMS sensors in MEP tender.

INITIATIVE 3: LED RETROFIT
   • Annual Savings:     $355,515
   • Payback Period:     1.5 Years
   • Implementation:     Mandate LED-only fixtures in tenant guidelines.

5. FINANCIAL PROJECTION (10-YEAR OUTLOOK)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Metric                  Standard Build          Smart Mall Build
----------------------- ----------------------- -----------------------
Annual Bill             $3,627,707            $1,965,156
10-Year OpEx            $36,277,073          $19,651,555
